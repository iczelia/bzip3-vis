# bzip3-vis

Simple bzip3 compression ratio visualisation web UI.

It's rather difficult to provide meaningful visualisations for the bzip3 algorithm as it mixes LZ-style string matching and BWT followed by arithmetic coding.
This results in seemingly random increases or decreases in compression ratio across the file. A more sophisticated version of the same tool would also
display the pre-coding neighbourhood.

## building

```

    -O3 -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s ENVIRONMENT=web \
    -s MODULARIZE=1 -s EXPORT_ES6=1 \
    -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_compute_coding_costs","_malloc","_free"]' \
    -s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS='["cwrap","lengthBytesUTF8","stringToUTF8","HEAPF32"]' \
    -o viz.js
